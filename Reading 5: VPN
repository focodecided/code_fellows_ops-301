### 1. What is a site-to-site VPN?

A site-to-site VPN refers to a connection set up between multiple networks, such as between multiple offices of a company or between a central office and branch locations. It allows the sites to securely access resources and communicate as if they were on the same local network.

### 2. What is TCP/IP and what is it used for?

TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. It outlines how data is organized into packets, assigned addresses, transmitted, and received between different computers on the internet or a private network. TCP/IP provides the fundamental communication system that the internet and early private site-to-site networks were built on.

### 3. What are some popular reasons for using a VPN?

Some popular reasons for using a VPN include:

To mask IP addresses and surf the internet more anonymously
To access geo-blocked content regardless of location
For better security when connecting to public WiFi networks
To prevent cyberattacks and enjoy encrypted connections
### 4. Explain the difference between the three types of VPNs.

The three main types of VPNs are:

Remote Access VPN: Provides temporary, secure connections between individual users and a central corporate location. Useful for remote workers.
Intranet Site-to-Site VPN: Connects multiple LANs across different physical locations to form a WAN. Allows sites to share resources.
Extranet Site-to-Site VPN: Connects multiple companies to allow them to securely share certain resources while keeping other data private.
The main difference is who/what is being connected - individual users, internal company sites, or separate companies.
