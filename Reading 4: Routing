### 1. Which network mode in VirtualBox can be used to emulate unplugging the Ethernet cable from the network?
The "Not Attached" network mode in VirtualBox can be used to emulate unplugging the Ethernet cable from the network. When enabled, it removes the network connectivity to the virtual machine.

### 2. Which network mode would be best if you wanted to run a server on a VM that could be fully accessible from your physical local area network?
The "Bridged Adapter" network mode would be best if you wanted to run a server on a VM that could be fully accessible from your physical local area network. This mode connects the VM directly to the physical network, allowing it to be accessed like any other host.

### 3. What are the three options of promiscuous mode and what does each do?
The three options for promiscuous mode are:
Deny: Traffic not intended for the VM is hidden from it
Allow VMs: The VM can see traffic sent to/from other VMs but not the overall network
Allow All: No restrictions - the VM can see all network traffic

### 4. What is Port Forwarding?
Port Forwarding is a process of intercepting traffic addressed to a particular IP address and port, and redirecting it to a different IP address and/or port. It allows external access to services running on VMs that otherwise would be hidden behind NAT.
