### 1. CIDR notation is a way to represent IP addresses and their subnet masks in a condensed format. A CIDR block is a range of IP addresses assigned to an organization or entity.
### 2. An IPv4 address consists of 4 octets separated by periods.
### 3. Each octet in an IPv4 address ranges from 0 to 255 using the decimal system.
### 4. The final digit after the "/" in a CIDR block indicates the subnet mask, specifying how many bits comprise the network portion of the address.
### 5. The CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24 has 256 IP addresses (2^8 possibilities for the last octet). The range is 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255.
### 6. Network segmentation involves separating a computer network into different zones, isolated by devices like firewalls, switches, and routers. It provides security by limiting access and containing threats.
### 7. No, I do not agree. Even with a well-configured firewall, network segmentation provides an important additional layer of security to limit damage in case of a breach. It protects critical assets.
### 8. A screened subnet is a DMZ subnet that exposes externally facing systems to the public internet, separating them from internal networks.
### 9. Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are examples of physical security controls.
